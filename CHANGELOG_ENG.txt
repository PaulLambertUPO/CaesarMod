CAESAR MOD - CHANGELOG

This file lists all the major changes made to the versions of the Caesar Mod published over time.


INTRODUCTION - DISCLAIMER

Thank you for downloading the Caesar Mod!
I’m Paolo Lamberto, a long-time player who has always been passionate about real-time strategy games and, among the many I love, the Imperivm games hold a special place as my absolute favourites ("Celtic Kings: Rage of War", "Nemesis of the Roman Empire" and, especially, "Great Battles of Rome").
However, despite my great passion for Imperivm, I never paid attention to what the community was doing: for years, I only played single player and later multiplayer with friends (via programs like Hamachi) on the GBR 1.40 vanilla version.
It was only by chance, out of curiosity, while searching for any DLC I might have missed, that I discovered a mod introducing Greece, a civilization I had never understood the original developers’ decision to exclude. I greatly appreciated the efforts of everyone who worked on it and, in my opinion, the definitive version of Imperivm GBR is this one, with all the major ancient civilizations (if we don’t include the Parthians, too).
At the same time, however, just as I discovered the wonder of the Greek Mod, I sadly realized that, in general, the great Imperivm GBR has been almost forgotten by everyone: there is an HD version on Steam, but it’s inferior to the Greek Mod and hasn’t been updated in years.
Even the Greek Mod itself, despite all its merits, had some issues and could have been further improved. That’s why I decided to step up and use all my knowledge and developer skills to contribute and make Imperivm a better game, hoping that someday the franchise will be rediscovered and appreciated by more and more people.
I then started working as a self-taught modder, beginning with the Greek Mod to create a new one, the Caesar Mod, aiming to improve every aspect of the game in order to offer everyone a product that provides a pleasant and memorable game experience, whether solo or with others, as well as offering a starting point to help others passionate about Imperivm with the same intentions as mine (it wasn’t easy at all working on a code base that was poorly optimized, very messy, and clearly amateurish in many areas, so I want to prevent others from wasting time fixing things like I had to do).
My passion for Imperivm is so great that it’s almost impossible to express in words and I also want to clarify that I have no intention of "stealing" what the creators of Greek Mod did. In fact, I’ve included a thank-you to them in the main menu credits and haven’t hidden any of their names, I’ve simply added my name alongside theirs.
If another person decides to use the Caesar Mod as a starting point for a new project, they are more than welcome to do so: the only courtesy I ask is that they do as I did and keep all the original names, specifying that they started from my mod and releasing the new project under the same CC BY-SA license, whose details can be found in the LICENSE.txt file included in the package.

[1.0.1] - 15 July 2025

This new version of the Caesar Mod fixes several bugs and exploits in order to make the game experience more enjoyable and to prevent some unfair behaviours in multiplayer games. During the development, I investigated why the endgame statistics related to lost and killed units are always inaccurate compared to the actual course of the match and, unfortunately, I found yet another issue related to the source code: the details are listed at the end of the file, in the section on not fixable bugs ("Erase" function).
Additionally, the scripts related to sieges and guard units in adventures have been completely overhauled in order to make the behaviour of the involved units smarter (they kept getting distracted by sentries) and to reduce the large amount of exploits that could be used to counter the enemies: besides improving the existing great battles/challenges, this change also lays the groundwork for the new adventures that will be introduced in the future versions of the mod.

CHANGES

- fixed the issue where the AI triggered the initial tactic in parallel with stronghold management on small maps
- fixed the issue where the AI didn’t recruit heroes during the initial tactic with Republican Rome
- fixed the issue where the AI sometimes recruited hastati instead of archers with Republican Rome
- fixed the issue where "divine grace" was blocked if the first of multiple selected heroes didn’t have enough stamina
- fixed the issue where double-clicking on the portrait of an activable skill in the top menu consumed stamina even if the skill was already in use
- fixed the issue where the patrol command made the game crash if there was an eagle among the selected units
- fixed the issue where the patrol command for regular units (not heroes) didn’t make them go back if they were inside a building
- fixed the issue where units attempted to capture a supply unit that had entered a building via the command of following an ally
- fixed the issue where the loyalty of a settlement that was just captured sometimes decreased even if no unit was actually capturing it
- fixed the issue where units in the process of capturing were counted as fighting units and triggered skills of heroes with auto-cast enabled
- fixed the issue where the amulet of courage increased the attack of non-military units, showing a numeric value instead of "none" next to the attack icon in the interface
- fixed the issue where the Teuton transformation command was blocked if the player of the first of multiple selected Teutons had not researched "Teuton master"
- fixed the exploit where it was possible to transform Teutons even without researching "Teuton master" if the player of the first of multiple selected Teutons had researched it (shared control)
- added description to the militiamen dismissal and Teuton transformation commands indicating they must be inside a building/ship (transforming outdoors could sometimes freeze the game)
- added patrol command to dangerous animals and removed from peaceful ones (their movements were inconsistent and animation-dependent at patrol start)
- uncontrollable peasants/hens: health and stamina reduced to 1, removed from effects based on nearby units (e.g. healing water, horn of victory, ...)
- rye spikes: removed priority from military units (it risked neglecting sages)
- Iberian catapult: centered the white/red positioning image on the pointer for the construction
- siege machine construction: time before taking damage increased to 14 seconds
- massively improved scripted sieges and guard behaviours in adventures
______________________________________

[1.0.0] - 2 June 2025

This is the very first version of the Caesar Mod: it is a project created with the aim of improving every aspect of the game through general rebalancing, introduction of new upgrades and mechanics, resolution of numerous issues, update of great battles, great challenges and conquests, AI improvement, and translations tuning.
As it is a "fork" of the Greek Mod 1.9, out of fairness, none of its creators have been hidden, and in the credits section of the main menu, a thank-you is explicitly given to them.
All the changes listed below use the Greek Mod 1.9 as a reference for comparisons on parameter increases/decreases and other adjustments.


GENERAL - MISCELLANEOUS

Here are listed gameplay changes common to all peoples and the resolution of many bugs.
The changes to specials and skills may seem strange at first, but everything will be clearer once you read the changes to individual units in the following sections; generally speaking, it can be said that overly strong abilities have been weakened, and those that were too weak have been improved. For example, "bleeding attack" now costs 3 stamina, no longer allowing weak units to eliminate any non-hero unit in a 1v1 situation, but providing a good boost that is still lethal if used in groups, while "learning" now costs 0 stamina, becoming a truly useful ability instead of a handicap.
The resolved bugs bring a revolutionary turn for certain units and peoples (especially for Carthage) and prevent certain types of exploits that could have turned into unfair play in multiplayer.
The updated help guide allows for a comprehensive consultation of almost all aspects of the game: in the original version of Imperivm there were inconsistencies and errors, making it almost meaningless to read; besides, in the main menu there is the tips box again, also updated to stay in line with the mod.

- fixed the issue where the "ritual chamber" compromised the research of subsequent upgrades in other strongholds
- fixed the issue where "Spartan training" reduced the maximum level from 12 to 10 if "special training" had already been completed and the reverse case at level 4 with "training" and 8 with "advanced training"
- fixed the issue where one had to research the same upgrade again if a subsequent instance was deleted when it was in progress from multiple buildings simultaneously
- fixed the issue/exploit where one could exceed the maximum limit of special or advanced German units if recruited from multiple buildings simultaneously
- fixed the issue where upgrades related to the maximum level of liberati, mountaineers, and valkyries did not account for units already present before recruitment
- fixed the issue/exploit where various bonuses (such as "democracy/oligarchy", "nobility", ...) were applied to units of other players attached to a hero (side effect of GetPlayerUnits)

STONEHENGES

The original stonehenge powers were almost unusable and so situational that they usually ended up helping the opponents rather than rewarding the caster.
The goal of these changes is to make stonehenges an important strategic location for which players must fight, encouraging them to focus on map control, which is one of the key aspects of Imperivm. For this reason, stonehenges now have a border like other buildings on the minimap, making them easily identifiable and usable without exiting the minimap view and the powers are more effective for the caster. The "starvation" power has received a huge increase in its cost to reduce the risk of almost completely blocking a Germany player.

- added the border visible from minimap
- removed stamina regeneration of a random nearby unit every second
- foraging: new power, cost 10 energy, all units restore food for 45 seconds every 15 seconds (3 food for caster's units, 2 for the others)
- wind of wisdom: cost increased to 20 energy, duration reduced to 20 seconds, maximum level limit increased to 30, bonus 5 experience for the caster
- soothing rain: cost reduced to 30 energy, stamina increment changed to 10 for caster's units and 5 for the others
- divine sacrifice: cost reduced to 40 energy, damage reduced to 50% for the caster, damage waiting time increased to 4 seconds
- gold rain: new power, cost 50 energy, adds gold to all buildings for 2 minutes (10 gold every 3 seconds, 15 gold for the caster)
- plague: new power, cost 60 energy, poisons 1 unit every 7 and 8 for the caster (excluding animals), cooldown 60 seconds
- bloodlust: cost increased to 70 energy, duration increased to 90 seconds, caster's units present at cast time gain 4 bonus damage for the duration
- starvation: cost increased to 80 energy, food removal percentage increased to 2, food removal halved for the caster
- earthquake: new power, cost 90 energy, damages all strongholds for 10 seconds (300 damage every second, 225 for the caster)
- Teuton horde: new power, cost 100 energy, spawns 40 riders, 40 archers and 20 wolves that are level 12 (18 for the caster) after 3 minutes in every stronghold depleting population


NEUTRAL GARRISONS

The goal of these changes is to make fights with neutral garrison troops more interesting both in the early and late game; once a certain power level is reached or with the right combination of units it will still be easy to win, but in the other cases the player will have to pay more attention, forcing them to improve their "micro" and "macro" management skills. However, the most important change is the removal of sentries from neutral strongholds: this is mainly aimed at the AI, as most of the time it would stop and waste too much time eliminating the sentries (a problem derived from the fact that the siege scripts are still the same ones used in the previous titles, where sentries didn't exist at all).

- guard units do not move out if there are only invisible enemies around and these are not considered for the capture
- British training outpost: all highlanders move out at the same time, initial level increased to 4, added 10 javelineers, at most 6 move out at the same time
- Iberian training outpost: defenders increased to 12, maximum level increased to 20
- German trade outpost: valkyries increased to 12, at most 8 move out at the same time, initial level increased to 10
- Gaul trade outpost: trident warriors increased to 6, at most 3 move out at the same time, maximum level increased to 30
- Roman gold outpost: liberati reduced to 18, initial level increased to 6, maximum level increased to 20
- Egyptian gold outpost: axe throwers reduced to 10, all move out at the same time
- Greek recruitment outpost: hoplites reduced to 20, initial level increased to 6, maximum level increased to 10
- Carthaginian recruitment outpost: macemen increased to 30, at most 16 move out at the same time, maximum level increased to 6
- Teuton tent: troops that move out in defense and gained at capture reduced to 10
- Numidian tent: troops that move out in defense and gained at capture reduced to 10
- guard post: spearmen and archers increased to 24, at most 14 move out at the same time
- stronghold: sentries reduced to 0


ITEMS

The goal of these changes is to make each game more varied and interesting by introducing new items and improving almost all of the existing ones. There were also some small subtleties that caused the items not to function as described and they have been fixed. Given how extreme certain item combinations can become, as you will read later, in single player and multiplayer matches, it will be able to choose whether to play on maps with or without ruins (items generated by other holders will still appear, but they are generally weaker).

- amulet of triumph: added 50% chance to heal 50 more health

- king's belt: obtainable in the lion throne every 30 minutes
- horn of victory: damage increased to 75, units hit increased to 15, does not consume uses if nothing is hit, added 1 second cooldown
- boar tooth: new item obtainable in the obelisks every 10 minutes, adds 2 levels, can be combined with 2 more identical items to create the boar teeth amulet
- boar teeth amulet: level increased to 6, removed from the items generated in the ruins, can be created with 3 single boar teeth
- belt of snakes: removed bonus damage in low health conditions, can be created directly by units
- finger of death: uses reduced to 5, targets increased to 4, eliminates any unit excluding heroes, kills in sequence, does not consume uses if nothing is hit, cooldown reduced to 3 seconds
- god's gift: also increases speed factor by 10%, disappears at the first kill even when the owner is at full health
- emblem of Democracy: health reduced to 80
- emblem of Oligarchy: damage increased to 6, also increases armor by 2

- noble defence: armor increased to 8

- rye spikes: food increased to 1000
- travel boots: new item obtainable in the ruins, increases armor by 4 and level by 2, regenerates 1 health to the owner and all attached units 2 times per second
- Egyptian charms: can be removed by double click
- battle drums of rage: new item obtainable in the ruins, add 30 damage to the owner and all nearby allies for 5 seconds upon activation
- skull of pain: new item obtainable in the skull tree every 20 minutes, adds 250 health, activating it subtracts up to 10% owner's maximum health to damage 6 nearby enemies by half that amount (not heroes)
- elephant tusk: regeneration increased to 25
- updated all icons and added missing ones to the dropdown selection for customized items in the editor


SIEGE

The goal of these changes is to provide some improvements to the interface and slightly rebalance the siege machines, especially thanks to the reintroduction of the manual attack command, useful for catapults when dealing with the "bubble" technique (i.e., a concentrated mass of ranged units, possibly surrounded by impassable objects like walls, rocks, or houses).

- tower: minimum range reduced to 150, range increased to 725
- catapult: range increased to 750, area of effect radius reduced to 150
- ram: speed reduced to 35, sight increased to 650, total duration increased to 50 seconds
- construction: time before taking damage reduced to 10 seconds, construction range reduced to 700
- restored the ceasefire and manual attack commands
- added range and health values to the interface
- varied the arcs of the shots from catapults of different peoples


ANIMALS

The original animals were really weak and posed no threat even in packs, making them quite useless even as summons by sages.
The goal of these changes is to strengthen and diversify them, giving them specials just as the units: the bear has become the strongest animal individually, the boar is much harder to kill especially in 1v1, the lion is lethal against units with low armor or when forming a pack, the wolf is the most annoying and an excellent support unit.
Now, players will need to pay attention to their supply routes and peasants, as they will be chased down and killed much more easily.
As it can be seen in the following sections, summoned animals can play a significant role even in major battles.

- bear: health reduced to 360, damage increased to 24, armor increased to 8, sight increased to 500, speed increased to 75, added "attack skill" and "determination"
- summoned bear: new unit with the bear stats and "combat skill" instead of "determination", total duration 30 seconds
- boar: health reduced to 320, damage increased to 20, armor increased to 6, sight increased to 450, speed increased to 70, added "combat skill" and "defense skill"
- summoned boar: new unit with the boar stats and "determination" instead of "combat skill", total duration 30 seconds
- lion/lioness: health reduced to 280, damage increased to 22, armor increased to 4, sight reduced to 550, speed increased to 80, added "active" and "triple strike"
- wolf: damage increased to 18, speed reduced to 140, added "drain" and "ferocity"
- summoned wolf: added "drain", "ferocity" and "combat skill", total duration increased to 200 seconds
- eagle: health increased to 50, sight increased to 1000, speed increased to 200, the editor one is no longer the summoned one and will not automatically die if stamina drops to 0
- summoned eagle: total duration increased to 120 seconds
- crow: health reduced to 25, sight increased to 950, speed increased to 180
- summoned crow: new unit with the crow stats, "keen sight" and total duration 240 seconds
- fish: health reduced to 100, sight reduced to 300, speed increased to 110
- deer: sight increased to 650
- summoned deer: new unit with the deer stats, speed 200, "keen sight" and total duration 180 seconds
- horse: health increased to 200, it does not become neutral near enemy strongholds, the taming command (along with its tooltip) now takes priority over the attack command once the "tame horses" upgrade is researched
- the health bar now also shows the stamina of most animals
- added stamina, speed, armor and sight of peaceful animals to the interface
- added sound effects for lions when they are idle
- fixed the class hierarchy for lions (now they extend "AttackAnimal" instead of "BaseAnimal")


BRITAIN

The goal of these changes is to diversify and improve Britain's gameplay style by enhancing the intermediate barracks units, Viking lords and druids.
Previously, the only truly effective unit was the highlander, possibly supported by javelineers or masses of archers with "assault cry" and "gambler's test", while all the other units were too weak or almost useless, being very easy to counter. Furthermore, the luck component has also been revised: in addition to the initial bet, Britain can now use another (repeatable) much more powerful and risky one, both allowing the player to still gain something even in case of loss, while the other upgrades in the tavern have been weakened to compensate for the new strength of the units ("gambler's test" has received a huge reduction in the chance of killing in one blow, but in return it can now provide a damage bonus to invisible units, which has been done on purpose to encourage the use of druids).
Now, Britain's main army combination consists of either spermen and javelineers or shield bearers and archers with "assault cry", but highlanders are still the best unit for the late game: initially, they are weaker than before because their base health has been reduced, but since they have "toughness" they are meant to become stronger as they level up, especially when they obtain the noble offence and defence, which now provide 8 as a bonus to their stats.
Recruiting new heroes has also been simplified thanks to the "wisdom" ability and to the fact that "fights" allows to hire them at level 6, while for units of the barracks (which, by the way, now finally has the "fastest warrior equipment" upgrade like all other peoples) a new blacksmith upgrade must be researched to train them at level 6 (to simplify the acquisition of "nobility"). The increase in damage and range for the hero (intended to balance the fact that he can miss the target) is compensated by the armor reduction, because, being a ranged unit, he cannot afford to get too close to the enemy.

- swordsman: health increased to 180, damage increased to 16, armor increased to 8, added "learning"

IBERIA

The goal of these changes is to further emphasize the Iberia's identity as a late game defensive people: in the early game, in fact, it is weaker than probably any other people, but as the game progresses it becomes nearly unstoppable thanks to the level reached by the heroes, who make their armies almost indestructible with the combination of "vigor", "healing", and "team defense".
The biggest changes for the units include a drastic increase to the recruitment speed of mountaineers, the removal of "expertise" for slingers (an ability that was too unbalanced because it was too powerful and often unpredictable since it wasn't very clear when it would take effect), and the increased cost of "bleeding attack" for elite guards. Mountaineers can now truly become an integral part of the Iberian army and no longer be the old "gold-and-time-eating trap" they were before. Slingers will now maintain their role as ranged anti-hero units to be kept away from the enemy thanks to "attack skill" and "defensive tactics", which works well due to their high level but removes stamina that would be useful for dealing more damage. Elite guards can still continue to use "bleeding attack" with relative ease thanks to "vigor", "ferocity" or "restoration"; without support they will not be as effective as before, but this is intentional to push the player to diversify their army composition.
Defenders are now worthy of their name and, in general, the two most effective combinations are defenders and slingers or elite guards and archers, with additional support from cavalry, priestesses, and muntaineers. The scout can now collect an item, which can be extremely useful for stealing poison mushrooms directly under the enemy's nose.
The biggest changes for Iberia overall include a significant increase in experience gain over time (rightly compensated with a higher cost), the reintroduction of the "veterans guild", the double level of "housing" to have an unmatched economy and the radius reduction for "cover of mercy" (it was really exaggerated, as a single cloud covered nearly an entire stronghold).

GERMANY

The goal of these changes is to make Germany the perfect definition of "high risk, high reward", that is a people solely and exclusively focused on causing as much damage as possible.
Previously, Germany's playstyle was quite inconsistent and/or restrictive: on one hand, the food costs to recover the population were high and a single "starvation" was enough to bring it to its knees; on the other hand, it had both "assault cry" and "defensive cry", a combination nearly impossible to counter for some peoples, further exacerbated by the great speed of "quick march" and/or the potential immunity to damage given by "concealment". This combination was terribly wrong when used with macemen because of the already mentioned "expertise" special which, combined with "attack focus", could turn it into a weapon that instantly wiped out armies clearly superior in both level and equipment within seconds.
That said, now the German hero almost exclusively has damage skills, while the units have been reworked accordingly, with a lower initial attack but potentially higher than before due to "team attack". The already mentioned maceman has become much healthier than before through "death blow" (much more manageable than "expertise") and "regeneration", deliberately added to compensate for the low armor and to give the impression of a "furious barbarian who does not know pain".
Another revolutionary aspect is the stamina cost for the "learning" special being eliminated, allowing the eponymous upgrade to actually be useful instead of a disadvantage. It is also possible to transform Teuton archers into Teuton wolves (the idea is to start by attacking at range as archers, then charge as wolves, and finally fight at close range as riders, then retreat and start again).
One last important aspect is that the valkyrie is now the fastest anti-archer unit in the game: a group of valkyries can easily decimate ranged units now by using "combat skill".

GAUL

The goal of these changes is to give Gaul a significant and deserved help and bring it back to the glory of the previous games.
The changes are many, in general the aim was to improve the basic units by providing various types of support to diversify the gameplay style (previously, the focus was almost entirely on horsemen), enhance "warrior tales" as they were nearly useless and partially bugged, make druids an integral part of the main army and give Gaul what it is best known for: heroes worthy of their name.
The general changes to specials and skills have made the trident warrior a truly formidable unit and valuable for his cost (though still easily counterable with the right units), while the base health redutcion for woman warriors combined with "toughness" is intended to encourage players to use training, especially now that druids are faster at performing the experience-learning animation from higher level units (the previous speed was ridiculously slow).
Gaul druids are to be considered the greatest masters of nature, so they now have the "reincarnation ritual", a new upgrade that, upon death, transforms them into either bears or boars of the same level: the changes to animals described in the dedicated section allow them to deal significant damage and/or effectively keeping the enemy busy.
However, the real novelty is the ability to recruit Keltill and Larax after researching all of the arena upgrades and after 45 game minutes: there is enough time to finish a normal game without seeing them appear, but if a tedious war of attrition begins, their arrival will undoubtedly turn the tide of the ongoing battle. Keltill is an excellent fighter designed to enhance basic troops, while Larax is a hero who can easily destroy entire armies on his own thanks to the advantage provided by the gem of the goddess Kathobodua (though he can still be countered with the right units, especially the praetorians, who are probably Gaul's greatest nemesis).

ROME

The goal of these changes is to emphasize the sense of power and discipline of the Roman troops, diversify the playstyle for all 3 versions of Rome and provide a valid reason to play Republican Rome over Imperial thanks to the one who gives the mod his name: Julius Caesar.
Previously, the gap between Republican and Imperial Rome (and partially Punic) heavily favored the latter and it was difficult to bridge that primarily because of the praetorians, "military academy" and "flexibility". At the same time, Imperial Rome had the problem that liberati were too weak and required too much gold to become decent (by dying multiple times), while Republican Rome focused almost all its resources on recruiting gladiators due to "expertise" (which has now been finally removed); meanwhile, principles tended to lose against most enemy units.
Now things have improved and become healthier: principles can use a combination of "attack skill", "defense skill" and "determination" to implement the use of the "testudo" formation and approach the enemy despite a rain of projectiles, then quickly eliminate it, though they tire over time; gladiators remain the unit to use when reaching a very high level thanks to "offensive tactics"; scouts are now the generally most effective explorers in the game thanks to "keen sight" (while "scout area" in the tavern no longer reveals hidden enemies); praetorians are still the strongest basic unit in the game and their cost has been consistently increased, but it can be reduced through a new upgrade in the blacksmith; liberati now have "bleeding attack" and are the most suitable special unit for eliminating other special units (this is thematically intentional, they are champions of arena combat and have faced the most varied opponents).
To summarize, the focus of Republican Rome now lies in the raw stats of the units via veteran upgrades and, just like Gaul with legendary heroes, in the possibility of recruiting Julius Caesar, probably the strongest hero in the game when it comes to improving the army; the focus of Imperial Rome still lies in the praetorians but also in other units before they can be equipped, as well as in the liberati (it is also possible to generate gladiators from the arena); Punic Rome has fewer upgrades than any other people but, to compensate and emulate the old mechanics of previous Imperivm games, all of its units have been given "toughness" and their icons have been changed.

EGYPT

The goal of these changes is to keep Egypt as the fastest people in the game, while at the same time putting a brake in front of it as it has generally been too strong/fast since the first version of Imperivm GBR.
This has been made possible through a revision of the costs of some upgrades and units: statues now cost 500 more gold (by the way, the Isis statue is now more useful than before, although the Osiris statue is still the better one); the swordsman, axe thrower and guardian cost less and have received some adjustments to their stats to better reflect their role; "buy slaves" no longer immediately maxes out the population but instead provides 20 inhabitants at a time.
Divine warriors have received a certain focus due to the changes to specials and skills and their cost has been increased since they are truly powerful now, temple units (chariot of Osiris and priest) have also received some revisions to provide alternative weapons to the main army (fortunately, now a single chariot can no longer poison an entire army without problems, though the increased speed makes it easier to poison enemies with "micro-management").
Charm costs have also been reduced and the unit cap to equip them has been increased, allowing a single purchase to equip an army of 50 units and all possible chariots of Osiris.

GREECE

The goal of these changes is to provide assistance to Greece as it was generally inferior compared to many other peoples, but especially to better distinguish its identity as a slow and defensive people and to address some issues related to units and upgrades.
Regarding the units, all of them have received improvements or adjustments balanced by an increase in cost: the peltast has received an improvement in attack speed because his slow throwing of the javelin was embarrassing, the toxotes now excels in ranged combat although he no longer drains stamina from the enemy, the hoplite can now truly absorb enemy blows for long and fulfill his role as a frontline unit, the hetairos is very powerful but slower due to heavy armor, the hypaspist excels in 1v1 combat but loses effectiveness if outnumbered, the chariot has been completely reworked by weakening its stats and removing the maximum limit and it still maintains its identity as a unit capable of dealing area damage, though not as excessively as before, since "trample" has been replaced with "determination" (which makes "spike armor" unlimited); finally, the myrmidon has received various general improvements, the first being a reduction in recruitment time (it still takes a while to recruit 50, but at least not an eternity like before) and the other being a dedicated upgrade to recruit higher-level ones, all balanced by reduced initial health and a higher cost.
Greece's upgrades have received some refinements, too: for example, Democracy has been slightly weakened to make more room for Oligarchy (which has been significantly strengthened) and to avoid researching the former in almost every game and a major focus has been placed on what allows the Greek stronghold to become an almost impregnable bastion: sentries can now be recruited from the townhall, "religious feast" has been added (to simplify training), food can be sold and, most importantly, "Apollo's protection" is now easier to execute and lasts twice as long, it is now available for every Greek fortress rather than just one and this applies to all players, so if someone conquers a fortress that has already been protected, they can protect it again (once).
The hero has also been improved: some stats have been added to align him more with the idea of a hero from an epic poem, and after an expensive series of upgrades, he can now be recruited at level 15 (which is certainly great, but still generally inferior to Rome's "military academy" and the hero's skills are a bit weaker than those of the Roman hero).

The goal of these changes is to support Carthage as it was one of the weakest peoples in standard games without bonuses, alongside Gaul and Greece, by enhancing its identity as a very rich people with weak but very numerous troops.
The intermediate units (Berber assassin and maceman) are now more effective at dealing damage, especially against heroes, but they remain relatively easy to counter and eliminate; the other barracks units have been revised to keep up with changes to the other peoples and the mod in general, they are still among the weakest in the game and they are only effective in large numbers or as a support for nobles and elephants. Speaking of these two units, the noble has now returned very similar to his original version from 1.40 with the idea of a very powerful and non-sacrificable unit that becomes stronger and more resilient as it levels up, thanks to the combination of "learning" (now no longer costing stamina) and "toughness"; as for the elephant, now that many issues have been resolved (such as bugs related to "revenge" for the dead or the damage against siege machines) it has received a small boost to its attack and speed but a relative reduction in its survivability and an increase in costs which, however, are not a problem for Carthage.
The Carthaginian market now offers many more commands and both economic and military researches, what stands out the most is: "hire foreign mercenaries", which allows you to recruit a mix of 50 units from other peoples all at once (this is based on historical facts), the improvement to "mercenary pact" to reduce the waste of potential spoils of war and the addition of both "increase population" and "sell food", along with a reduction in cost and gain for "slavery" enabling its use in games with a maximum population of 50 without necessarily resorting to stronghold overcrowding.
Finally, the Carthaginian blacksmith has been revamped to make it more tactical while also removing many issues: now, developing a weapon costs more than before but from the second time onward the cost is refunded and the research is much faster; this forces the player to keep some gold in reserve in case they need/want to change specialized units but allows them to do so more comfortably and avoid wasting gold if they realize late that they made a mistake.

RANDOM MAPS

The goal of these changes is to provide greater variety to single player and multiplayer game, as well as offer some quality and convenience improvements for players, for example by automatically creating initial supply routes or by automatically assigning the level 12 hero obtained via the bonus to the first quick selection icon.
The most important change by far is the possibility to choose whether to play with or without ruins on any map type, something that was not possible before and was limiting, especially since ruins didn't exist on maritime maps by default.

TUTORIAL

The tutorial has remained very similar to the original and the only changes made primarily aim to fix some issues and bugs which, however, were not very noticeable and/or required deliberately deviating from the mission instructions to be triggered.

GREAT BATTLES AND GREAT CHALLENGES OF ROME

Tons of changes have been made to all the missions to make them more engaging to play and more memorable, as well as to fix various issues that could be annoying or ruin the game experience. Additionally, countless spelling and grammar mistakes have been corrected, and the English version of each game has been aligned with the Italian and Spanish versions (the only thing still missing is the conversation audio). The details are listed in a distinct section for each scenario, as they are too numerous to include in one place, along with a difficulty and duration rating based on some tests at maximum difficulty after the changes were made (this is subjective and may vary from player to player, but it can still be useful for giving a general idea of what to expect).

- corrected countless spelling and grammar mistakes
- corrected player interface based on the played people
- corrected the names of all players
- added English version support (but without conversation audio)


LANDING IN AFRICA

The landing in Africa remains the game's easiest great battle, with tweaks aimed at addressing various issues and making the battles with Syphax and Hannibal more engaging.
The confrontation with Syphax will force the player to be careful not to let Masinissa die because without him the Numidians will not participate in the final battle (this was already the case in the original version but was not specified), which, thanks to the skills and new items given to Hannibal, will be much more challenging and will require greater "micro-management" skills of Scipio's army.
The player can still choose to stay in Utica before the battle of Zama and trivialize things by recruiting a huge mercenary army, but since there are no more gates it's no longer easy to trick the AI and waste its time continuously by heavily damaging it with sentries, which, by the way, can no longer be upgraded.

Difficulty rating with tests at hard after the changes: easy
Duration rating with tests at hard after the changes: short

- fixed the issue where if for some reason the initial units went too far along the path a cutscene started where Masinissa was approached by enemy Tuaregs and the game softlocked

- support caravans: food increased to 2000 each
- Iberian reinforcements: waiting time between moves reduced to 30, 20 or 10 seconds based on difficulty
- Syphax's army: added a hero with 50 Numidian horsemen with the objective of killing Masinissa, heroes with Numidian footmen and Berber assassins prioritize recapturing Utica

- dead tree: replaced healing water with bag of healing water


THE SIEGE OF NUMANTIA

The siege of Numantia has been completely revamped to provide the player with a much more engaging great battle.
There are continuous clashes with groups of enemy reinforcements that never stop being generated and these groups no longer spawn in the nearest enemy outposts but in specific fixed areas to give the player time to capture some buildings before they get close and the fight begins. This has been done to create the feeling of an exhausting siege that the Iberians continuously attempt to thwart, which historically happened.
Now the player is no longer defeated if all buildings are lost (which was previously not even specified) but only if Scipio dies, so there is a chance to reclaim at least one of the gold outposts to obtain valuable reinforcements: the enemies, in fact, first aim to reclaim everything, then they will head en masse towards the Roman commander.
It will not be easy to maintain control of all buildings, so it will be important to know when to attack Numantia and always keep some defensive units in the rear to avoid the siege being hindered by attacks from behind.
Overall, the difficulty has definitely increased and, to address this, reinforcement units (especially those from training outposts) have been improved and it will also be possible to use witch huts, ruins, chests, and "gold rain" (while being careful to protect the mages) to acquire additional resources.

THE SIEGE OF ALESIA

The siege of Alesia has been modified to provide the player with the experience of what can be considered the most difficult siege in ancient history and Julius Caesar's most spectacular masterpiece.
As a result, the Gaul waves coming from both outside and inside Alesia have been varied and generally enhanced to create an incessant and exhausting battle. The player will be pushed to maximize their "macro-management" skills to deal with the enemy attacks and recapture lost fortifications (hint: for gold outposts, it is extremely useful to station peasants inside them).
The key to victory lies in knowing how to correctly move hero-led armies as well as various groups of units: this emphasizes the concept of strategy and, as a result, it is possible to play the entire battle almost exclusively from the minimap; all of this has been deliberately designed to provide even more satisfaction to the player, making them feel like a true general on par with Julius Caesar.
It will be a huge relief when the attacks from the outside cease, because by that point the player's troops will be much more than seasoned veterans and capturing the main city of Alesia will be even more enjoyable.
Speaking of that, the city's defenses have been strengthened to prevent the player from sending all the initial troops to capture it and finish the scenario before the real battle even begins (this was possible before and it wasn't even hard to win that way).

AUGUSTUS ON THE NILE

Augustus on the Nile has undergone a huge amount of changes and it was a miracle that the original version even worked because the sequences and scripts were total chaos, there were also missing and/or incorrect translations.
The goal of the changes is to make the scenario much more interesting and dynamic: this has been made possible both by various tweaks to the map itself and by the changes to the AI (see the dedicated section).
This scenario can be seen as a single player game embellished with special mechanics, such as the increased utility of recruitment outposts, the presence of a gold outpost, Sudanese troop assaults and the constant maritime attacks on Pelusium from the city of Alexandria.
The latter city is now impossible to conquer with the initial troops (which have been improved and made consistent, as they were previously random) because the defenders are much stronger, there are two superpowered ships guarding the port (to make it harder to disrupt the maritime attacks), but most importantly because Mark Antony and Cleopatra along with extremely powerful armies have been added, designed to be faced only at the end of the game, when the player has reached an enormous power level.
Meanwhile, the constant assaults from the Sudanese tribes on Memphis never stop being generated, even after the stronghold is captured, turning into massive reinforcement groups should they defeat the defenders (previously, they would no longer appear after the capture of the townhall).
The city of Pelusium has been strengthened to help the player after the buffs to the enemies: there are more resources and, thanks to the addition of the temple of Horus and Anubis, additional heroes can be recruited and statue upgrades researched, finally there are also some water sources for quickly healing the troops.
A significant amount of bugs and exploits has been fixed, for example by completing the walls of Alexandria and Pelusium or by preventing the player from landing the initial units before completing the naval battle; if the player somehow manages to do that, the population of the villages will still remain at a minimum to prevent the player from using it to transform peasants into mercenaries before proceeding correctly with the scenario.

Difficulty rating with tests at hard after the changes: medium/hard

THE CONQUEST OF BRITAIN

The conquest of Britain has been revisited with the goal of providing an engaging large-scale single player game with some special mechanics.
Various bugs related to strange behaviors of both enemies and allies have been fixed, as the latter often interrupted the siege of Lindum or Dumnorium to enter certain buildings and do nothing.
The real revolution of the scenario is actually due to the changes made to the AI, which is now much more dangerous than before (see the dedicated section) and much more active in retaking the strongholds and villages that the player will capture during the great battle.
The allied support groups have been diversified and improved by introducing even some Greek units while the ancient Stonehenge, thanks to general modifications made to the stonehenges, will be a very useful tool in the player's hands (provided they can capture and hold it), especially with "gold rain" and "Teuton horde" which, despite the limit of only one use, will allow the player to fully exploit their potential once many cities have been conquered.
In particular, "Teuton horde" will be essential to win the final battle against Calgacus's army, as it has been greatly strengthened and will no longer be easily eliminated already at the Lindum stronghold, since all the gates and part of the northern walls have been removed (the army tended to get stuck while continuing to eliminate the sentries and did not capture the townhall).
Finally, as explained in the introductory cinematic, the northern Caledonians were experts in ambush tactics, so the player will need to be careful where they step: there are seemingly safe places and paths that could turn out to be a deadly trap if the player doesn't have sufficiently numerous and/or trained forces.

MARCUS AURELIUS IN GERMANY

Marcus Aurelius in Germany has been partially modified to make the defense of the city of Aquileia more interesting.
First of all, the end-game cinematic is now the correct one, whereas before it would start the victory one for the conquest of Britain.
The German waves are now larger and become more and more dangerous as the game progresses, so the player will need to move their troops correctly between the gold outposts, the villages and the stronghold, attacking the enemy from multiple points at the same time. Luckily, this becomes easier once the hero with the scouts is unlocked, who has been renamed and updated to unleash hell at his signal.
Once the main waves are over, the enemies will now continue to strike periodically, although with a reduced frequency and at a lower level, simply to give the player something to do while preparing for the final attack on the enemy camp.
It will be essential to make the best use of liberati and praetorians against the valkyries in the camp, as they are now equipped with many items that increase health in addition to a considerable level. However, this will also be quite easy by making the best use of the army of Roman allies that arrive to assist the villages.
Finally, it's a good idea to send someone (preferably Marcus Aurelius) to explore the map and collect the hidden items around, as they will prove very useful.
In general, the enemies are much stronger than before but the game will still be easy thanks to all these aids, along with the enormous wealth that the 3 gold outposts can provide if used right from the start.

HANNIBAL AT THE GATES OF ROME

Hannibal at the gates of Rome has undergone a series of adaptations that haven't changed the overall dynamics of the game but have made Rome's defense much more tenacious and the reinforcements from Ostia more interesting.
The player must quickly capture this city before the Roman armies start to arrive and, once the stronghold is taken, they can receive reinforcements that now can vary randomly: there is a weak army made up of mercenary infantry units, a medium-strength army made up of mercenary cavalry units and a very powerful one made up of nobles and an elephant.
The player will be able to personally witness the immense power of the nobles attached to Hannibal, essential for capturing Rome, as its defenders will not give an inch.

VIRIATO DOMINATES HISPANIA

Viriato dominates Hispania remains the easiest great challenge, the tweaks aim to eliminate some issues/exploits and make the moment when the player surpasses the early stages of the game more satisfying.
First of all, the end-game cinematic (English) is now the correct one, previously, instead, it was played the one for Arminius, rebel general.
In the original version, just with the initial troops it was possible to capture the outposts in the east and eliminate the guards at the camp and shipyard, making the game incredibly easy due to Larax's early arrival, not to mention the fact that one could even bypass any enemy by passing through the western coast and capture the shipyard almost unchallenged.
Now, that is no longer possible because rocks block the path while the enemies stationed at the outposts have generally been improved: as a result, the player will need to pay more attention, research some upgrades and recruit additional units before managing to reach the shipyard.
All of this has been intentionally done to encourage the player to use guerrilla tactics against the Roman armies coming from Saetabis, something that was already required before but could be avoided with the mentioned exploits; in fact, there are also some horses that can be captured to recruit scouts with for such goal.
When the player frees Larax, they will have plenty of choices on which items to assign to him and Viriato: with the right combination of equipment, Larax can reach 300 damage. The two heroes, for those who don't know, are the protagonists of the tutorials in the previous titles, so their encounter is not a mere coincidence.
At this point, the player will be free to do whatever they want and the capture of Saetabis will be much more fun than before.

EGYPT TO ARMS

Egypt to arms has been revamped to fix multiple bugs and to become more logical in terms of difficulty progression.
The Roman armies are initially weaker than before but they become more and more powerful, still maintaining a random generation factor but that makes more sense than the previous version: there was too much discrepancy between the units attached to the heroes, sometimes after two attacks praetorians and/or tribunes would come and they were nearly impossible to stop in the early game, while other times very weak units would show up even in the last attacks, making the game experience inconsistent.
The player will have to make great use of divine warriors and war elephants to defend against the final attacks: luckily, summoning the divine warriors has been simplified by the addition of the new upgrade "slavery investment", which helps quickly recover the population of the villages, while the Carthaginian market and the gold outposts (including the mercenary fort itself) can provide the wealth needed for the elephants.
Priests can prove to be a very effective weapon against the enemy thanks to the use of the plague mist and to the presence of a shrine with which they can cast some powers: the most useful of these is undoubtedly "wind of wisdom" to increase the heroes' level.

THE BATTLE OF GERGOVIA

The battle of Gergovia has been modified to become much more dynamic and satisfying, as well as to fix some bugs and issues (like the fact that the initial troops were defeated during the introductory cutscene).
On a general level, the scenario is the same as before: the player must defend against enemy waves preventing too many tribal chieftains from being killed and finally protect the stronghold from a large assault, or from an immense, nearly unstoppable army if the chieftains die too early.
However, now the units making up the Roman waves have been diversified while the Gallic defenders have been improved as they were too weak: in the original version (assuming the introductory cutscene was overcome), few Roman soldiers were enough to eliminate both the chieftains and a good part of the troops defending Gergovia even before the final attack and the poor amount of resources in the stronghold combined with the low population made it impossible to recruit decent units for support, which resulted in a likely final defeat and the almost mandatory use of exploits.
All of that has changed and now the challenge for the player remains fair but not impossible and, with a minimal dose of "macro-management", it is fairly possible to move the heroes and the armies to the right points at the right time.
The old Ercenbehrt has been replaced with Luthal, one of the heroes from the main adventure of "Celtic Kings", and Vercingetorix's skills have been improved.
Once the main waves are eliminated, a massive Roman army will attack in force from the central road, combining all the groups of the individual waves along with a hero and a strong army: however, this army has the "frenzy" skill, which will actually be helpful to the player if they recruit many woman warriors.
If the player wins, they will also see Julius Caesar himself leaving the battlefield and hear a comment from Keltill that does not exist in the original game, a new addition specific of the Caesar Mod.

ARMINIUS, REBEL GENERAL

Arminius, rebel general has been modified to fix a huge amount of bugs, issues and exploits and to make the final ambush execution more satisfying.
It is no longer possible to recruit additional heroes now: the player will have to move Arminius where needed based on the situation while trying to keep the trade outposts filled with units in order to make the ambushes work.
There is also to be cautious of the periodic attacks on the secret camp: these are not very powerful per se but, due to the constant reinforcement of troops at the trade outposts, the camp will often be left unprotected and therefore easy to capture.
The game is significantly simplified by immediately researching "learning", which can be fully utilized by sending Arminius to the destroyed village to fight the animals and collect the items there.
Some changes have been made to how ambushes work to provide more convenience to the player: now, troops return to the outposts after battles rather than staying outside (thus eliminating the risk of not participating in the following ambushes if the player doesn't notice) and all of them will join the fight (which wasn't the case before).
The final ambush will be much easier if the player keeps their units inside the buildings (including Arminius). This was actually already happening in the original version, but a combination of bugs caused the immediate victory as soon as the troops spawned in the swamps and the Italian/Spanish translation was completely misleading because it suggested sending the troops to the swamps without mentioning this mechanic at all.

BOUDICCA'S REBELLION

Boadicea's rebellion has been completely revised to fix some issues and provide a hybrid gameplay experience between single player and old-school adventure with the goal of making it one of the most challenging experiences.
The Romans and the Trinovantes are now enemies and will fight each other if they cross paths, the AI has been disabled and replaced with periodic and continuous attacks on the Iceni stronghold both to prevent it from accessing certain areas of the map and to keep the player's focus on the defense of only one stronghold. As a result, both the cursed stronghold and the Trinovantes one, once captured, will provide useful and safe resources to the player's arsenal.
The amount of initial resources has been significantly increased to cope with the immediate barrage of enemy attacks and to offer a long-term help: enemy armies have different spawn times and are able to accumulate, which makes them extremely dangerous.
The cave has also become more dangerous: the periodic damage occurs much more frequently and the enemies have been grouped and strengthened, but the addition of a hidden rib cage in a point on the map will allow the player to choose a reward different than the blood stone (see dedicated section).

FORGE YOUR EMPIRE

The goal of these changes is to make the "conquest" game mode much more fun and engaging with a huge series of changes to maps and mechanics in order to fully leverage the AI potential (see dedicated section).
Several bugs have been fixed (the most notable being the issue with neutral villages/shipyards not always being automatically captured, which tended to permanently block the AI in the original version) and improvements have been made to people bonuses and to resource generation for the player; now it's also possible to choose which Rome version to play with in each game, no longer limited to Republican Rome only.
If the AI reaches the peak of its power (especially on the highest difficulty), it will overwhelm the player with enormous and powerful armies, leading to continuous and memorable battles; an early game immediate attack can prevent this from happening, it's a valid tactic but for the best and most satisfying gameplay experience it's better to proceed normally.
It is essential that the player understands the strengths and weaknesses of each people before playing on the highest difficulty and knows which bonus is best to choose against the people they wish to subjugate.
For each map, the special features and mechanics have been emphasized to create a sort of alternative mini-adventure.

MARE NOSTRUM

The previous version of "Mare Nostrum" had incredible maps in terms of pure geographical scenery, but the gameplay left much to be desired because the AI wasn't strong enough and there were no special mechanics in any of the maps, so it was like playing a single player game with the double advantage of having a special bonus and very weak enemies fighting among themselves.
All bug fixes and changes to resources, bonuses and mechanics from "Forge your empire" have been replicated here and each map has been enhanced with a series of improvements and characterizations through the addition of various buildings related to the people living there.
Thanks to these improvements, the player can now truly experience the feeling of a large-scale conquest game.

ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

Since a complete revision of almost all the scripts has been made, the changes are too numerous and complex to be fully described, so only the main ones will be listed here. In general, it can be said that the changes aim to make the AI much more powerful, as it now has access to all the main game upgrades without artificial limitations or blocking constraints and it also recruits military units that were previously not considered due to bugs and/or incorrect script programming. Besides, if the AI has enough gold at the start of the game and the map is not small, it will follow a tactic that grants it some enhancements and a good initial army, allowing it to progress more easily than before (there are 40 tactics in total, 4 for each people except Rome, which has 12 due to its 3 variants). All the changes were primarily focused on the "chaotic hard" AI, but the other difficulty levels have also automatically received improvements, both directly and indirectly.

- fixed various issues related to the type and name of the upgrades (settlement/player) as well as different obsolete parts that were still tied to the functioning of the previous titles
- fixed the issue where the costs of several researches performed were not added to the spent resources statistics
- fixed the issue where the AI did not attack Teuton/Numidian tents at all or did so but "intermittently"
- fixed the issue where the AI was not able to capture buildings when using squads without heroes because of a continuous command reset
- heroes use poison mushrooms also when they have the elephant tusk, the ring of power, the ashes of druid heart or enough healing water to restore at least half their health
- horses added to the animals hunted by heroes to level up, priority to level 10 animals if "gambler's day" has been completed, neutral slingers excluded from the units farmed to gain experience
- optimized the order of the upgrades researched for each people (while still maintaining a minimal variability) and removed overly blocking dependencies on other upgrades when the need is assessed
- minimum minutes for sentry upgrades of chaotic AI reduced to 20 and 30, minimum minutes for "strengthen stronghold gates" reduced to 25 for chaotic AI and to 15 for defensive AI
- barracks maximum level increased to 1 for easy AI and reduced to 2 for medium AI (initial tactics do not consider it)
- added Numidian horseman recruitment for Carthage
- added supreme heroes recruitment for Rome and Gaul (hard AI only)
- increased the variety of units recruited for each people, all units are always enabled and without maximum number/power limits (special units limit increased for easy AI to about 50% of the maximum possible)
- improved hero skills usage
- managed construction of common, Roman or Egyptian ship based on the played people
- added transport of resources stored in shipyards and Teuton/Numidian tents towards strongholds
- added usage of the nearest trade outpost to sell food for gold (disabled for easy AI)
- added desperate defence system: the AI ​​recruits as many basic units as possible (Numidian footmen or javelin throwers for Carthage depending on specialization) to defend the stronghold from enemies who have entered
- added decision system for the best barracks for Greece (less commands in queue, although without considering their actual duration, change intended for scenarios/adventures where there are more identical buildings)

______________________________________

KNOWN BUGS

Here are listed some bugs that may be fixed in future versions of the mod. Unfortunately, not all of them are fixable, as they require access to the game's source code.

FIXABLE
- the Egyptian hero with the "bobbed" hair changes the color of his clothes when he fights, always becoming red even when it shouldn't be
- the golden elite guard (level 18+) goes back to "metallic" when he fights
- the toxotes movements are not in sync with his own shadow

TO BE INVESTIGATED FURTHER
- sages sometimes try to attack catapults by performing a cover-attempting animation, blocking any other action -> requires analysis of both scripts and animation files
- transforming a unit (e.g. via "Teuton master") does not maintain the original speed factor -> likely not fixable without generating overhead
- every now and then, for no apparent reason, the game crashes -> maybe it's related to some scripts, but it's more likely due to some intrinsically buggy function or incorrect memory management in the source code

NOT FIXABLE
- the "Erase" function triggers the effects related to the death of units (such as "warrior tales") and increases the lost units counter (sentries returning to towers are the main cause)
- the speed factor change for a hero only works in fight phase and not in movement phase
- units with modified speed factor slow down the entire army when they are attached to a hero
- dead units with "gambler's luck" that are hit by "trample" can generate the same "resurrection" bug that occurred with "wrath of Jupiter"
- in the map editor, when creating a group by selecting objects from the appropriate button in the window, if among these there is something that is not a unit (for example the camp tents), the game crashes
- in the map editor, when an item is assigned to multiple units and then many of them are selected together, at least one of them will have the object removed
- in the map editor, sometimes a hero's skill or item disappears after changing their icon
- in the map editor, if the only change made is the resizing or moving of areas, the user is not prompted to save when exiting, resulting in the loss of the changes
