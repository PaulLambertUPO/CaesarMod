			<entry>
Over the course of the game, some parts of the map appear covered in a semi-transparent mist, while others are in absolute darkness: this effect is called "fog of war".

The black areas are those that have not yet been explored and on which there is no information.

Whenever you pass through these areas with your units, the terrain is revealed and you can see the enemy units and buildings located there.

However, if you have neither units nor buildings in the explored areas, the mist limits your field of vision and, although it allows you to see the terrain and the buildings there, it prevents you from observing enemy units.

			<entry hcenter="1" font="large">Minimap</entry>
			<entry>
The minimap is a scaled representation of the terrain: to toggle it, you can use the spacebar, the mouse wheel pression or the specific button located at the bottom of the screen.

The white rectangle shows the area of the main view. You can recognize buildings and units by the color of the player they belong to.

To see enemy buildings on the minimap it is sufficient to pass by them once with your units, while to see enemy units it is necessary that they are in the line of sight of at least one of your units or buildings.

			<entry hcenter="1" font="large">Resources</entry>
			<entry>There are two resources: food and gold.</entry>
			<entry image="UI/InfoBar/Common/Food_Cost.bmp">
Food is produced in every village and in German strongholds.
It is essential for maintaining the health of all units and it can also be used to increase the population of strongholds and to recruit units.
			</entry>
			<entry image="UI/InfoBar/Common/Gold_Cost.bmp">
Gold is automatically collected in each stronghold and stored in the respective townhall, the central building.
It is necessary for issuing orders in buildings and for recruiting units.
			</entry>
			<entry>
The greater the population of a village or stronghold is, the greater its production of food and/or gold will be.

Resources are stored in settlements (strongholds, villages, outposts and shipyards).

They are used where they are, but if you want to use them in another place you have to transport them with caravans, which must be protected from attacks by the enemy and fierce animals so that you do not lose everything that is being transported.

			<entry hcenter="1" font="large" vcenter="1">Capturing</entry>
			<entry image="UI/Help/CmdBar/Actions/Capture.bmp">Capturing buildings is an essential element to achieve victory. If you master this aspect of the game, you will be able to confidently tackle any mission you want.</entry>
			<entry image="UI/InfoBar/Common/Loyality.bmp">Each building has a loyalty stat that appears at the top of the screen, next to its icon, when the building is selected.</entry>
			<entry>
When a building suffers a capture attempt, the loyalty decreases: if it reaches zero, the building is captured and its color becomes that of the new owner.

The number of units attempting to take over a building determines how quickly it is conquered, but it must always be greater than the number of nearby units of the owner to succeed. Loyalty can decrease or increase by up to 10 at a time.

The maps of Single player and Multiplayer games have a variable number of neutral villages and outposts: the villages are automatically conquered by the first player who reaches them, while the outposts are conquered only after their stationed guarding units are eliminated.

		<topic id="feeding">
			<entry hcenter="1" font="large">Feeding</entry>
			<entry>
Each unit can carry up to 20 food (the tuareg 40 and the war elephant 100) which it will consume over time.

Units restore health by feeding and do so much more quickly if they are inside a building.

When food reaches zero, the unit's health decreases every time that it should feed, down to a limit of 10% maximum health.

If your soldiers have other points on the map as their destination, you must transport the necessary supplies to feed them there.

				<entry hcenter="1" font="large">Health</entry>
				<entry>
The health of a unit represents its general state: when it goes down to 0, the unit dies, while when it returns to maximum by healing, any disease is eradicated.

When you select a unit, a health bar appears under its icon. The green section represents the unit's current health, the red section represents the missing health. There are also the corresponding numerical values, located in the unit's interface.

If you select several units, the bar shows the average health of the entire group and there is also the numerical value corresponding to the percentage.

If you press the ';' key you will be able to see, above each unit, a green/yellow/red bar representing its health and another with blue dots showing its stamina.

				<entry>
The stamina of a unit represents its general energy. Each unit can have a maximum of 10 stamina, which allows specials to be activated.

When the stamina is too low, the unit cannot use specials and it must wait for the stamina to regenerate.

If you press the ';' key you will be able to see, above each unit, a green/yellow/red bar representing its health and another with blue dots showing its stamina.

			<topic id="level">
				<entry hcenter="1" font="large">Level</entry>
				<entry>
The level of a unit represents its overall experience. The higher the level is, the higher the experience required to level up, the higher the dealt damage and the lower the received damage will be.

The experience of a unit increases at every kill, depending on the victim's level. It is also possible to gain experience by training units, with training outposts or specific upgrades.

The level of the selected unit appears next to its name, preceded by an 'L' icon.

				<entry hcenter="1" font="large">Damage</entry>
				<entry>
The damage of a unit represents the attack power in battle. The actual amount of damage dealt depends on the enemy armor and on the level of the units engaged in the fight.

If the opponent's armor is equal to or greater than the unit's damage, the unit inflicts only 20% of that damage value. The minimum possible damage is 3 (and can be brought down to 1 with the Iberian "Cover of mercy").

For example, if a warrior with 40 damage hits an enemy of the same level with 10 armor, he will deal 30 damage; if a warrior with 20 damage hits an enemy of the same level with 20 armor, he will deal 4 damage.

The damage of ranged units also depends on the target's current health: the lower the latter is, the lower the chance of hitting will be.

The armor of a unit represents the defense power in battle. The actual amount of damage received depends on the enemy attack power and on the level of the units engaged in the fight.

If the opponent's damage is equal to or greater than the unit's armor, the unit receives only 20% of that damage value. The minimum possible damage is 3 (and can be brought down to 1 with the Iberian "Cover of mercy").

For example, if a warrior with 10 armor is hit by an enemy of the same level with 40 damage, he will receive 30 damage; if a warrior with 20 armor is hit by an enemy of the same level with 20 damage, he will receive 4 damage.

The armor against ranged units also depends on the current health: the lower the latter is, the lower the chance of being hit will be.

			<entry>
Heroes are proud warriors with fight stats superior to those of normal troops and are distinguished by almost always riding a white horse.

Each hero also has a set of special skills that can be improved with each level up: some are passive and provide constant bonuses of various kinds, others can be activated for a cost in stamina to obtain powerful temporary bonuses.

All heroes also have "Divine grace", a skill that allows them to restore up to 100 health at the cost of 4 stamina.

In addition to possessing extraordinary abilities, heroes are able to lead allied troops (except those with "Freedom"), forming groups of up to 50 units (increasable up to 80 with the skill "Administration").

Units attached to a hero receive as a bonus a part of his experience, which is added to theirs, as long as they remain attached. The action of selecting, moving, or giving orders to the hero extends to attached units.

Heroes can order their troops to arrange into different types of formations. Holding down the right button when moving a hero allows you to deploy troops in the desired direction, with the addition of a bonus based on the formation chosen.

In addition to the basic stats, almost all units have a set of specials that make them even more unique and effective against certain enemies.

Most specials consume stamina: when it decreases too much, it is necessary to wait for it to regenerate.

In addition to the stats common to all units, each hero has 5 skills that differentiate him from the heroes of other nations; the only exception is Julius Caesar, who has 6.

Some of these skills are passive and enhance only the hero, others only the attached units, others both and finally some skills can be activated and come into play only by paying a cost in stamina.

Every time that a hero levels up, an intermittent '+' symbol appears in his selection interface to show that one of his skills can be improved (up to 10 points each).

Essence of fury and barbarism, Germany has at its disposal the most brutal and fierce warriors of the ancient world, led by bold and fearless leaders who are the epitome of the "high risk, high reward" philosophy.

The stonehenge is a sacred magical place that allows powerful rituals to be cast and have an effect on the entire the map and for all players.
Casting such spells requires energy that is produced by the presence of sages, provided that there are no enemies around: the greater the amount of sages is, the greater the energy generation will be.
Spells have a better effect for the caster, so it is essential to fight to maintain control of the stonehenge.

The ruins, remnants of other times, are dangerous places where only the most fearless heroes dare to go, driven by the desire to obtain powerful magic items worthy of their level.
To acquire an item, the hero must be of the specified level (displayed in the top left when the ruins are selected). Upon exiting the ruins, the hero's health is always 20% of the maximum.
Once the magic item has been obtained, 10 minutes must pass before another one appears and the minimum level required increases by 4.

When a hero level 13 or above dies, a stone monument to honor him is built and from there it is possible to recover the items he possessed as well as obtain other benefits; the duration of the grave before it is consumed depends on the hero's level.

Over the course of the game you can find various items (magic and not) that can be of great help to you in achieving your goal and overpowering your enemies. If the opportunity arises, do not hesitate to pick them up.
Items can be collected in ruins or in special containers, easily distinguishable as they are often surrounded by small stones, or they can be generated through researchable upgrades in various buildings.
There are different types of objects: some must be used and consumed in order to be effective, others just need to be equipped, others provide passive bonuses and can also be activated without being consumed, finally others are only effective if in the hands of a hero.
To use an activable item, you have to double-click on its icon and then, depending on the item, you may need to select a target.
Each unit can carry a maximum of 4 items, while heroes 5; the only exceptions are the Iberian scout (1) and Larax (6).
