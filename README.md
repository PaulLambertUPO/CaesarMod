# Caesar Mod
This is the full collection of uncompressed archives of the Caesar Mod for Imperivm Great Battles of Rome


## HOW TO REPACK ARCHIVES
Depending on the type of archive you are creating via the "Arch.exe" tool, you have to choose the right option:
- for ".bfhp" archives, select "Haemimont HPFS"
- for ".pak" archives, select "Haemimont Pack File (read-only)"


## ADVENTURES
All custom adventure folders (e.g. "Tutorial") and all GreatBattles-GreatChallenges subfolders (e.g. "3_Great_Battles_Alesia") must be repacked as ".bfhp" archives. To make sure they have a proper image in the game menu, they must be accompanied by a ".bmp" file with the same name.

Note that the game currently only lists the first 6 files for each subfolder, which means that it's not possible to add other historical battles in the game panels (that's also the reason for which they have numeric prefixes). If you really want to replace a historical battle with a new one, you should put the battle year in the title and you must rename the file properly to make it fit in the right place with the right format.


## CONQUESTS
They work exactly like custom adventures: ".bfhp" archives accompanied by ".bmp" files.


## LOCAL
All of the language folders must be repacked as ".pak" files.


## PACKS
The folders "emptyadv", "emptyconquest", "emptyscn", "newmap", "RandomMapSettlements" and "RandomMap_bfhp" must be repacked as ".bfhp" archives (remember to remove the "_bfhp" suffix from the last one), all of the others must be repacked as ".pak" archives (remember to remove the "_pak" suffix from the last one, although it is not mandatory).


## SCENARIOS
They must be repacked as ".bfhp" archives (there is no need to have an image for them).
